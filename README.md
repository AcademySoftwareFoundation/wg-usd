# Universal Scene Description Working Group (USDWG)

The purpose of the USD working group is to support the community as the
USD project is increasingly adopted and deployed. This working group provides
a vendor-neutral form to assist adoption efforts through documentation,
sharing of explorations, new developments, and best practices.

The TAC sponsor of this working group is Cory Omand (Pixar/TWDS).

Goals of the WG are:

1. Assist community members with issues raised in USD support channels.
2. Survey, study, document, and share best practices for deployment of USD technologies.
3. Provide a venue for community presentations of new and updated developments, integrations, and research.

Non-goals of the WG are:

1. This working group is not a steering committee.
2. This working group has no special influence on USD, or other third party projects.

## Deliverables

1. Documenting vetted solutions for solving the most common issues raised on the usd-interest forum
2. Position papers and other documents representing consensus opinions on USD related topics
3. Documentation describing best practices for
    * structuring USD assets
    * making use of USD features
    * setting up development environments on supported platforms.
4. Video recordings of community presentations given to the working group.
