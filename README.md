# Universal Scene Description Working Group (USDWG)

The purpose of the USD working group is to support the USD project as it is
adopted and deployed. Strong industry-wide interest in USD is beyond the
capacity of Pixar alone to support. The aim of this working group is to assist
adoption efforts through consolidation and sharing of best practices, and
helping with issues raised in various USD support channels where possible.

Goals of the WG are:

1. Assist community members with issues raised in USD support channels.
2. Consolidate and share best practices for deployment of USD technologies.

Non-goals of the WG are:

1. This working group is not a steering committee. Members on the working
   group have the same influence on the direction of the USD project as any
   other member already participating in the USD community.

The TAC sponsor of this working group is Cory Omand (Pixar/TWDS).
