## Apologies

## Agenda/Minutes

* Action item follow-up [0:00-0:10]
    * Cory: Slack channel in ASWF slack
        * Prefer to keep most communications on usd-interest
    * Cory: Python documentation
        * Some current issues in docstring build and release of Python documentation.
    * Cory: TAC ratification
* Outline current proposals (determine scope, identify lead)
    * Continuous integration [0:10-0:25]
        * Since USD 20.05, CI already running in Azure, no binaries yet.
        * Build flavours create a large matrix
            * Main switches are: Python on/off, Imaging on/off
        * Testing in the public Azure CI is limited (Linux only, no GPU), much
          Pixar-internal testing is currently image-based around linux-only
          perceptual diff
        * Daniel: CI working group progress on distribution/testing. Find the
          right way to share infrastructure between the GH Actions/Azure
          pipelines. Support the effort without needing to duplicate effort.
        * Kass: Can see if possible to donate GPU hardware or GPU compute instances for testing effort.
* Best practices/Knowledge base [0:25-0:50]
    * Cory: USD documentation editing / publishing workflow currently not
      suited to non-Pixar contributions
    * Cory: Discussed PEP-style best-practice approach with USD team, who want
      to avoid fracturing docs / API samples. Also want to manage the problem
      of versioning of docs, best practice against code.
    * Kass: Would a public wiki be acceptable?
    * Cory: USD team concerns about accuracy / maintenance 
    * Kass: Wikipedia model shows robustness of decentralised and
      crowd-sourced contributions and maintenance.  May sit alongside a more
      moderated PEP-style process.
    * Alan: Collection of examples need not be best-practice to be valuable.
      Cory: Wiki formatting much better for later discovery than email.
      SeanLooper: Wiki allows for discussion to be captured with examples for
      later distillation into best practice
    * Sue: An important factor is making examples accessible to less technical
      community, this includes richer media
    * Daniel: USD-wg GitHub repo does have a wiki with configurable access
      mechanisms: https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/documenting-your-project-with-wikis
    * Daniel: There may be IP / licensing questions around contributions.
      Cory: Action item to check with ASWF
* Determine action items/next steps [0:40-0:50]
    
## Action Items
* Alan: Propose categories for knowledge base
* Cory: Create knowledge base category wiki doc in wg-usd.
* Cory: Discuss wiki approach with USD team.
* Cory: Discuss Azure/GH Actions GPU testing with USD team.
